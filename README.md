## ⚡ What is it?
**IMG2JPG Optimizer** is a **macOS Apple Silicon** app (M1, M2, M3, M4) that optimizes your JPEG, PNG, HEIC, GIF, and WebP images by converting them into **optimized progressive JPEGs** using [MozJPEG v4](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg).  

- **Huffman-optimized compression**

- PNG/HEIC/GIF/WebP → JPEG conversion via built-in **ImageMagick**  
- **Standalone app**  
- Simple interface: **drag-and-drop** designed for macOS Apple Silicon

## 🚀 Why use it?
- Image size reduced by **20–70%** with no visible quality loss  
- Huge time saver when preparing images for the **web**, **presentations**, or **quick sharing**  
- Compatible with all browsers and editors
